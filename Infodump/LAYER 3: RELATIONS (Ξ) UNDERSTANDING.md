# **LAYER 3: RELATIONS (Ξ) UNDERSTANDING**

*How do systems actually work?*

------

## **BEFORE YOU START**

### **Prerequisites:**

```
YOU MUST COMPLETE L1 & L2 FIRST.

Specifically:
□ Baseline stable (L1)
□ Capacity building (L2 spiraling)
□ Ready for theory (not in crisis)
□ Curious about systems (want to understand, not just survive)

If you're drowning: Go to L1
If you're stuck in loops: Go to L2
If you're stable and curious: Continue to L3
```

------

### **What Layer 3 Is For:**

```
You're here because:
  □ Surviving ✓ (L1 working)
  □ Building ✓ (L2 spiraling)
  □ Want to understand HOW systems operate (not just react to them)
  □ Ready for formal frameworks (CRIT, K4, patterns)
  □ Curious about leverage points (where to push)
  □ Want to predict before acting (simulation)

Layer 3 is:
  - Frameworks for understanding ANY system
  - Pattern recognition across contexts
  - Leverage point identification
  - Scenario simulation (mental testing)
  - Systemic literacy

Layer 3 is NOT:
  - Changing systems (that's L4)
  - Action/organizing (also L4)
  - Just theory (without application)
  
It's: Understanding the physics of how complexity works
```

------

### **The Five Components:**

```
L3.1: CRIT Equation → Relations defining entities
  Universal framework: Δ = Ξ(Ω × Φ)
  
L3.2: K4 Kernel → Relations structuring flow  
  Four primitives: Entity, State, Relation, Flow
  
L3.3: Pattern Recognition → Relations recurring
  100+ documented patterns across contexts
  
L3.4: Leverage Points → Relations determining state
  Where to push for maximum impact
  
L3.5: Scenario Simulation → Relations determining trajectory
  Mental testing before real commitment
```

**Work through in order.**

**Each builds on previous.**

------

## **L3.1: CRIT EQUATION**

*Relations defining entities - Ξ-Ω*

------

### **What It Is:**

Universal equation describing how complexity emerges:

```
Δ = Ξ(Ω × Φ)

In words:
Observable State = Relations coupling Entities and Flow

This is THE equation.
Everything else in Soulware derives from this.
```

------

### **The Five Variables:**

------

### **Ω (OMEGA): ENTITY**

**Definition:** Persistent pattern/structure that maintains identity over time

**Examples:**

```
Physical:
- You (your body persists despite cells replacing)
- River (pattern persists despite water flowing through)
- Hurricane (structure persists despite air molecules changing)

Social:
- Company (persists despite employees changing)
- Family (persists despite members coming/going)
- Nation (persists despite population turnover)

Abstract:
- Habit (pattern persists over time)
- Culture (persists across generations)
- Language (persists despite speakers changing)
```

**Key Property:** PERSISTENCE

```
Entity = what remains when everything else changes
Not: The stuff it's made of
But: The pattern that organizes the stuff
```

------

### **Φ (PHI): FLOW**

**Definition:** Movement, energy, gradients, becoming

**Examples:**

```
Physical:
- Water flowing
- Heat dissipating
- Light traveling
- Electricity moving

Metabolic:
- Blood circulating
- Food digesting
- Breathing in/out
- Energy transforming

Social:
- Money flowing
- Information spreading
- People migrating
- Attention shifting

Abstract:
- Time passing
- Change happening
- Process unfolding
- Becoming (rather than being)
```

**Key Property:** MOVEMENT

```
Flow = what moves through entities
Not: Static
But: Dynamic, directional, rate-dependent
```

------

### **Ξ (XI): RELATION**

**Definition:** Connection, interaction, coupling between entities/flows

**Examples:**

```
Physical:
- Gravity (relates masses)
- Electromagnetic (relates charges)
- Chemical bonds (relates atoms)

Biological:
- Predator-prey (relates populations)
- Symbiosis (relates organisms)
- Food web (relates species)

Social:
- Employment (relates worker-employer)
- Friendship (relates people)
- Contract (relates parties)
- Market (relates buyers-sellers)

Information:
- Causation (relates cause-effect)
- Correlation (relates variables)
- Implication (relates statements)
```

**Key Property:** COUPLING

```
Relation = what connects entities/flows
Not: The entities themselves
But: The structure of their interaction
```

------

### **Δ (DELTA): STATE**

**Definition:** Current observable configuration/complexity

**Examples:**

```
Individual:
- Your mood right now
- Your energy level
- Your current situation
- Your observable behavior

System:
- Current weather
- Stock market value
- Traffic density
- Social tension level

Emergent:
- Collective mood
- System stability
- Phase (solid/liquid/gas)
- Regime (democracy/autocracy)
```

**Key Property:** OBSERVABILITY

```
State = what you can measure/observe NOW
Result of all the Ξ, Ω, Φ interactions
The "output" of the system
```

------

### **uΔ (u-DELTA): BASELINE STATE**

**Definition:** Time-averaged attractor state, where system trends

**Examples:**

```
Individual:
- Baseline mood (generally anxious vs generally calm)
- Baseline energy (chronically tired vs typically energetic)
- Life trajectory (improving vs declining vs stable)

System:
- Climate (vs weather)
- Economic regime (growth vs stagnation vs collapse)
- Political equilibrium (stable vs volatile)

Attractor:
- Where system returns after perturbation
- Long-term trend beneath short-term fluctuations
- Baseline that state hovers around
```

**Key Property:** TENDENCY

```
uΔ = where system TRENDS over time
Not: Current state (that's Δ)
But: Baseline that Δ oscillates around
```

------

### **The Equation Explained:**

```
Δ = Ξ(Ω × Φ)

VERBAL:
"Observable state emerges from relations coupling entities and flows"

UNPACKED:
- Ω (entities) exist
- Φ (flows) move through/between entities
- Ξ (relations) structure how entities interact with flows
- Δ (state) emerges from that coupling
- uΔ (baseline) is where Δ trends over time

CAUSAL CHAIN:
Ω × Φ = "Entities encountering flows"
Ξ(...) = "Relations structure that encounter"
Δ = "Resulting observable state"

Example:
- Ω: You (entity)
- Φ: Work pressure (flow)
- Ξ: Employment relation (structures encounter)
- Δ: Exhaustion (observable state)
- uΔ: Chronic burnout (if sustained)
```

------

### **Recursive Dynamics (The Feedback):**

**Critical:** State feeds back to change everything

```
Δ(t) → Ξ(t+1), Ω(t+1), Φ(t+1)

Meaning:
Today's state influences:
- Tomorrow's relations (Ξ changes)
- Tomorrow's entities (Ω adapts)
- Tomorrow's flows (Φ shifts)

Which produces:
- New state Δ(t+1)
- Which feeds back again
- Recursive loop

This is why systems are complex:
Not: Linear cause → effect
But: Circular feedback → adaptation → new state → feedback...
```

**Example:**

```
t=0:
- Ω: Healthy person
- Φ: Manageable work pressure
- Ξ: Sustainable employment relation
- Δ: Functioning well

t=1:
- Δ (exhaustion from overwork) feeds back:
  - Changes Ω: Person now exhausted (entity degraded)
  - Changes Φ: Can't handle as much flow (capacity reduced)
  - Changes Ξ: Relation becomes exploitative (boundary violation)
- New Δ: Worse state

t=2:
- Worse Δ feeds back:
  - Further degrades Ω (chronic illness)
  - Further reduces Φ capacity (can barely work)
  - Further strains Ξ (boss frustrated, more pressure)
- Even worse Δ

This is LOOP (degenerative spiral down).

Unless:
- Change Ξ (quit job, set boundary)
- Change Φ (reduce pressure somehow)
- Restore Ω (recovery time)

Then: Can spiral UP instead of down
```

------

### **State vs uState (In Depth):**

**The Distinction:**

```
Δ = Current state (moment-to-moment)
uΔ = Baseline state (time-averaged attractor)

Analogy:
- Weather = Δ (today's conditions)
- Climate = uΔ (long-term average pattern)

Δ fluctuates wildly
uΔ changes slowly

Δ is what you observe now
uΔ is trajectory over time
```

**Why This Matters:**

```
Bad day (Δ spike) ≠ Life falling apart (uΔ degrading)
Good day (Δ dip) ≠ Life improving (uΔ rising)

Track uΔ, not just Δ

Questions:
- "Am I getting better over months?" (uΔ)
- Not: "Am I having good day today?" (Δ)

- "Is baseline rising, stable, or falling?" (uΔ trend)
- Not: "How do I feel right now?" (Δ moment)
```

------

### **Application Domains:**

------

### **Three Complete Examples:**

**Example 1: Personal Burnout System**

```
SYSTEM: My work-life situation

Ω (ENTITIES):
1. Me (my body, capacity, baseline)
2. My employer (company as entity)
3. My role/job (position as entity)

Φ (FLOWS):
1. Work pressure (tasks, deadlines, demands)
2. My energy/attention (flowing into work)
3. Money (salary flowing to me)

Ξ (RELATIONS):
1. Employment contract (structures exchange)
2. Boss-worker hierarchy (structures power)
3. Productivity expectations (structures pressure)

Δ (CURRENT STATE):
Exhausted, overwhelmed, irritable, barely functioning, making mistakes

uΔ (BASELINE TRAJECTORY):
Degrading - baseline getting worse over months, not recovering on weekends

FEEDBACK LOOPS:
Exhaustion (Δ) → Makes me less productive (Ω degraded) → Boss adds more pressure (Ξ changes) → Even more exhausted (worse Δ) → Loop

INTERVENTION POINTS:
- Change Ξ: Set boundaries (work hours), or quit job (exit relation)
- Change Φ: Reduce workload, delegate tasks, say no to new projects
- Restore Ω: Take medical leave, force recovery time, rebuild capacity
```

**Example 2: Social Media Addiction System**

```
SYSTEM: My relationship with Instagram

Ω (ENTITIES):
1. Me (user entity)
2. Instagram (platform entity)
3. My attention (cognitive entity)

Φ (FLOWS):
1. Content flowing through feed (algorithmically curated)
2. My attention flowing into app
3. Dopamine flowing in my brain (intermittent reinforcement)

Ξ (RELATIONS):
1. Engagement optimization (algorithm structures what I see)
2. Addiction mechanics (variable rewards structure my behavior)
3. Social comparison (platform structures how I relate to others)

Δ (CURRENT STATE):
Scrolling 3 hours/day, feeling inadequate, can't stop, missing other activities

uΔ (BASELINE TRAJECTORY):
Degrading - increasing usage, decreasing wellbeing, baseline mood declining

FEEDBACK LOOPS:
Feel inadequate (Δ) → Scroll more to feel better (Φ increases) → See more curated perfection (Ξ feeds me comparison content) → Feel MORE inadequate (worse Δ) → Loop

INTERVENTION POINTS:
- Change Ξ: Delete app (break relation), unfollow accounts that trigger comparison
- Change Φ: Set time limits, replace with different flow (different activity)
- Restore Ω: Remember my worth ≠ social media performance, therapy, self-compassion
```

**Example 3: Capitalist Wage System**

```
SYSTEM: Employment under capitalism

Ω (ENTITIES):
1. Workers (labor entities)
2. Capitalists (owners entities)
3. Means of production (factories, tools, resources)

Φ (FLOWS):
1. Labor power (workers' time/energy)
2. Goods/services produced
3. Money (wages, profit)

Ξ (RELATIONS):
1. Wage labor (worker sells labor, capitalist buys)
2. Private property (capitalist owns means of production)
3. Market competition (structures prices, wages)

Δ (CURRENT STATE):
Workers underpaid, overworked, barely surviving
Capitalists accumulating wealth
Inequality increasing

uΔ (BASELINE TRAJECTORY):
Degrading for workers - wages stagnant, cost of living rising, wealth concentration increasing

FEEDBACK LOOPS:
Workers underpaid (Δ) → Can't save/invest (Ω can't become capitalist) → Must keep selling labor (Ξ unchanged) → Still underpaid (Δ persists) → Wealth gap widens (uΔ degrades) → Loop

INTERVENTION POINTS:
- Change Ξ: Unionize (change power relation), cooperative ownership (change property relation), policy change (minimum wage, labor rights)
- Change Φ: Strike (withhold labor flow), mutual aid (alternative resource flow)
- Not really Ω: Can't individually "fix" workers or capitalists, structural issue

(Note: Individual can't change this system alone - requires collective action, hence L4)
```

------

### **Common Mistakes:**

**MISTAKE 1: Confusing Δ and uΔ**

```
Wrong: "I had a good day, my life is fixed!"
Right: "Good day (Δ up) but baseline (uΔ) unchanged yet, need sustained change"
```

**MISTAKE 2: Thinking Ω is the substance**

```
Wrong: "I am my body/brain/cells"
Right: "I am the pattern that persists despite cells replacing"
```

**MISTAKE 3: Ignoring feedback loops**

```
Wrong: "If I just fix Δ once, I'm done"
Right: "Δ feeds back to change Ξ/Ω/Φ, must address feedback"
```

**MISTAKE 4: Focusing only on Ω when Ξ is the issue**

```
Wrong: "I need to be more resilient" (trying to change entity)
Right: "I need to change the extractive relation" (change coupling)
```

------

### **Success Metrics:**

**You understand CRIT when:**

```
□ Can identify Ω, Φ, Ξ, Δ, uΔ in any system
□ Understand difference between state and baseline
□ Can trace feedback loops (Δ → Ξ/Ω/Φ)
□ See how relations couple entities and flows
□ Can apply to personal, social, economic systems
□ Think in CRIT terms automatically
```

**Ready for L3.2 when:**

```
□ CRIT makes sense (not just intellectually, intuitively)
□ Want more precision (need the four primitives)
□ Ready for K4 Kernel (foundation beneath CRIT)
```

------

## **L3.2: K4 KERNEL**

*Relations structuring flow - Ξ-Φ*

------

### **What It Is:**

Four irreducible primitives that everything is built from:

- **Entity** (persistent pattern)
- **State** (current configuration)
- **Relation** (connection/interaction)
- **Flow** (movement/becoming)

**Why "Kernel":**

```
Like OS kernel = core that everything runs on
K4 = core that all systems run on

Can't reduce further.
These are atomic.
Everything else = combinations.
```

------

### **The Four Primitives:**

------

### **PRIMITIVE 1: ENTITY**

**Definition:** Persistent pattern/structure

**Symbol:** Ω (Omega - end/completion, what persists)

**Properties:**

```
- Persists over time
- Maintains identity despite change
- Has boundaries (inside vs outside)
- Can be physical or abstract
- Scale-independent (works at any level)
```

**Recognition Questions:**

```
"What persists here?"
"What has identity over time?"
"What remains when parts change?"
```

**Examples Across Scales:**

```
Micro: Atom, cell, person
Meso: Family, company, city
Macro: Nation, ecosystem, planet
Abstract: Habit, belief, culture
```

------

### **PRIMITIVE 2: STATE**

**Definition:** Current configuration

**Symbol:** Δ (Delta - difference/change, what is now)

**Properties:**

```
- Observable/measurable
- Changes moment-to-moment
- Result of all interactions
- Can be quantified
- Context-dependent
```

**Recognition Questions:**

```
"What can I observe right now?"
"What's the current configuration?"
"What's measurable about this moment?"
```

**Examples Across Scales:**

```
Micro: Particle position, cell voltage
Meso: Person's mood, room temperature
Macro: Weather, economy, social tension
```

------

### **PRIMITIVE 3: RELATION**

**Definition:** Connection/interaction

**Symbol:** Ξ (Xi - unknown variable, what couples)

**Properties:**

```
- Connects entities
- Structures interactions
- Can be symmetric or asymmetric
- Can be physical or abstract
- Determines system behavior
```

**Recognition Questions:**

```
"How do these connect?"
"What structures the interaction?"
"What's the relationship between X and Y?"
```

**Examples Across Scales:**

```
Physical: Gravity, electromagnetic, chemical bonds
Biological: Predator-prey, symbiosis, competition
Social: Employment, friendship, hierarchy, market
Information: Causation, correlation, implication
```

------

### **PRIMITIVE 4: FLOW**

**Definition:** Movement/becoming

**Symbol:** Φ (Phi - golden ratio, what moves harmoniously)

**Properties:**

```
- Directional (has source and sink)
- Has rate (fast or slow)
- Conserved or dissipating
- Creates gradients
- Enables change
```

**Recognition Questions:**

```
"What's moving?"
"What's the direction?"
"What's the rate?"
```

**Examples Across Scales:**

```
Physical: Water, heat, light, electricity
Metabolic: Blood, nutrients, oxygen, waste
Economic: Money, goods, labor, capital
Information: Data, signals, ideas, attention
```

------

### **How They Combine:**

**K4 is complete basis:**

```
Every system describable using just these four:

Simple system:
- 1 Entity + 1 Flow = Entity processing flow

Complex system:
- N Entities + M Flows + P Relations = Complex adaptive system

Everything = combinations of K4
```

**Examples of Combinations:**

```
ENTITY + FLOW:
River = Water (entity pattern) + flowing water (flow through pattern)

ENTITY + RELATION:
Network = Nodes (entities) + edges (relations between them)

FLOW + RELATION:
Market = Money/goods (flows) + trade relations (structure flows)

ENTITY + FLOW + RELATION:
Body = Organs (entities) + blood/nutrients (flows) + vascular system (relations)

ENTITY + STATE + FLOW + RELATION:
Society = People (entities) + current conditions (state) + resources (flows) + social structure (relations)
```

------

### **K4 Mapping Protocol:**

### **K4 vs CRIT (How They Relate):**

```
K4 = The four primitives (building blocks)
CRIT = How the primitives interact (the physics)

K4 says: These four things exist
CRIT says: Here's how they combine to produce complexity

K4 = Ontology (what exists)
CRIT = Dynamics (how it behaves)

Use K4 to: Identify components
Use CRIT to: Understand interactions

Together: Complete framework
```

------

### **Success Metrics:**

**You understand K4 when:**

```
□ Can identify all four primitives in any system
□ Understand what makes each primitive irreducible
□ Can map systems using K4 protocol
□ See how primitives combine to create complexity
□ Use K4 vocabulary automatically
```

**Ready for L3.3 when:**

```
□ K4 is intuitive (see patterns everywhere)
□ Want to recognize recurring structures
□ Ready for pattern library
```

------

## **L3.3: PATTERN RECOGNITION**

*Relations recurring - Ξ-Ξ*

------

### **What It Is:**

Library of recurring relational structures that appear across contexts.

Once you recognize a pattern, you can:

- Predict its behavior
- Identify its failure modes
- Know where to intervene
- Recognize it instantly next time

**The Goal:**

```
Build intuition for systems
By recognizing patterns
That repeat everywhere

Eventually: "Oh, this is [pattern name]"
Instant systemic literacy
```

------

### **The Four Categories:**

------

### **CATEGORY 1: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS**

*How entities are arranged*

------

**PATTERN 1.1: HIERARCHY**

```
Structure: Entities arranged in levels with top-down control

Properties:
- Clear authority chain
- Information flows up (reporting)
- Commands flow down (orders)
- Power concentrated at top

Examples:
- Military (ranks)
- Corporation (management pyramid)
- Government (executive authority)
- Family (patriarchal structure)

Strengths:
+ Clear decision authority
+ Efficient for simple coordination
+ Scalable (can get large)

Weaknesses:
- Information bottlenecks
- Top disconnected from bottom
- Rigid, slow to adapt
- Single point of failure

Failure Modes:
- Tyranny (top abuses power)
- Bureaucracy (process over function)
- Revolution (bottom overthrows top)
```

------

**PATTERN 1.2: NETWORK**

```
Structure: Entities connected peer-to-peer, distributed

Properties:
- No central authority
- Many pathways between nodes
- Resilient to node failure
- Emergent coordination

Examples:
- Internet (distributed architecture)
- Mycelium (fungal networks)
- Social movements (decentralized organizing)
- Peer-to-peer systems

Strengths:
+ Resilient (no single point of failure)
+ Adaptive (can reorganize)
+ Democratic (no enforced hierarchy)

Weaknesses:
- Slower coordination
- Harder to make collective decisions
- Can fragment
- Vulnerable to infiltration

Failure Modes:
- Collapse (too fragmented)
- Capture (powerful nodes dominate)
- Inefficiency (can't coordinate)
```

------

**PATTERN 1.3: CYCLE**

```
Structure: Entities arranged in circular flow/sequence

Properties:
- Closed loop
- Each entity affects next
- Can be stable or unstable
- Can be virtuous or vicious

Examples:
- Water cycle (evaporation → precipitation → runoff → repeat)
- Economic cycle (boom → bust → recovery → repeat)
- Abuse cycle (tension → incident → reconciliation → repeat)
- Spiral Engine (encounter → decode → experiment → observe → integrate → repeat)

Strengths:
+ Self-sustaining (if virtuous)
+ Predictable rhythm
+ Can stabilize system

Weaknesses:
- Can trap (if vicious)
- Hard to break
- Can be extractive

Failure Modes:
- Vicious cycle (degenerative spiral)
- Interruption (cycle breaks, chaos)
- Acceleration (cycle speeds up unstably)
```

------

**PATTERN 1.4: CASCADE**

```
Structure: Sequential triggering, one leads to next

Properties:
- Linear progression
- Each stage enables next
- Can be slow or rapid
- Often irreversible

Examples:
- Avalanche (snow → more snow → more)
- Bank run (one withdrawal → panic → more withdrawals)
- Revolution (protest → repression → bigger protest)
- Ecological collapse (one species dies → others follow)

Strengths:
+ Can amplify small initial push
+ Can create rapid change

Weaknesses:
- Hard to stop once started
- Can be catastrophic
- Often unpredictable

Failure Modes:
- Runaway (unstoppable collapse)
- Premature halt (cascade stops too soon)

Recognition: "Doubling time" or "half-life"

Intervention: Introduce limiting factors (for growth) or input (for decay)
```

------

**PATTERN 2.5: THRESHOLD/TIPPING POINT**

```
Behavior: Small push creates sudden large change

Properties:
- Non-linear (not gradual)

- Surprising (seems sudden)
- Critical value exists

Examples:
- Phase transition (ice melts at 0°C)
- Market crash (confidence loss)
- Revolution (regime suddenly falls)
- Ecosystem collapse (resilience exceeded)

Recognition: Gradual change → sudden shift

Types:
- Simple: Clear threshold (temperature)

```

------

### **CATEGORY 3: RELATIONAL PATTERNS**

```

------

**PATTERN 3.2: MUTUALISM**

```
Relation: Both entities benefit

Properties:
- Symmetric exchange
- Both gain more than they give
- Self-reinforcing (both want to continue)
- Stable over time

Examples:
- Biological (bees pollinate, flowers provide nectar)

- Social (healthy friendship)
- Collaboration (both grow)

Recognition: Sustained mutual benefit

Subtypes:
- Obligate: Both need each other (can't survive alone)
- Facultative: Both benefit but not required

Intervention: Protect and nurture (rare, precious)
```

------

**PATTERN 3.3: COMPETITION**

```
Relation: Both want same limited resource

Properties:
- Zero-sum or negative-sum
- Creates winners/losers
- Drives adaptation OR exhaustion
- Can be fair or rigged

Examples:

Intervention: Protect prey, limit predator, change power dynamic
```

------

**PATTERN 3.5: COMMENSALISM**

```
Relation: One benefits, other unaffected

Properties:
- Asymmetric but not harmful
- Neutral to host
- Opportunistic
- Often transitional (becomes mutualism or parasitism)

Examples:
- Biological (bird nests in tree - tree unaffected)
- Economic (street vendor benefits from foot traffic)
- Social (listening to someone's public conversation)

Recognition: One-way benefit without harm

Intervention: Usually none needed (harmless)
```

------

### **CATEGORY 4: INFORMATION PATTERNS**

*How information moves and transforms*

------

**PATTERN 4.1: SIGNAL/NOISE**

```
Pattern: Relevant information vs irrelevant

Properties:
- Signal = meaningful pattern
- Noise = random variation
- Ratio determines detectability
- Context-dependent

Examples:
- Communication (message vs static)
- Data analysis (trend vs variance)
- Attention (important vs distraction)
- Social (truth vs propaganda)

Recognition: Trying to extract meaning from chaos

Intervention: Filter noise, amplify signal, change signal-to-noise ratio
```

------

**PATTERN 4.2: ENCODING/DECODING**

```
Pattern: Information transformed for transmission

Properties:
- Information compressed/transformed
- Requires shared code
- Lossy or lossless
- Can be intentional or emergent

Examples:
- Language (ideas → words → understanding)
- DNA (genes → proteins)
- Money (value → currency → value)
- Culture (meaning → symbols → meaning)

Recognition: Transformation preserving meaning

Failure Modes:
- Lossy compression (meaning lost)

- Smaller representation
- Faster transmission
- May lose detail
- Enables scaling

Examples:
- Abstraction (specific → general)
- Summarization (long → short)
- Categorization (many → few)
- Models (complex → simple)

Recognition: Fewer bits, same meaning (roughly)

Trade-off: Efficiency vs accuracy

Intervention: Choose appropriate compression level for context
```

------

**PATTERN 4.4: PROPAGATION**

```

- Cascade (person to person)
- Viral (exponential growth)

Intervention: Change network structure, seed strategically, introduce competing meme
```

------

**PATTERN 4.5: FEEDBACK (Information)**

```

------

### **Using Pattern Recognition:**

**When You See A System:**

```
STEP 1: STRUCTURAL
What's the arrangement? (Hierarchy, network, cycle, hub-spoke?)

STEP 2: DYNAMIC  
How does it behave over time? (Feedback loops, oscillations, thresholds?)

STEP 3: RELATIONAL
How do entities interact? (Parasitism, mutualism, competition?)

STEP 4: INFORMATIONAL
How does information move? (Signal/noise, propagation, feedback?)

STEP 5: NAME IT
"This is [pattern name] operating"

STEP 6: PREDICT
Based on pattern, what will likely happen?

STEP 7: INTERVENE
Based on pattern, where can I push?
```

------

### **Pattern Combination:**

**Real systems = multiple patterns:**

```
Example: Capitalism

STRUCTURAL: Hierarchy (corporate) + Network (market)
DYNAMIC: Positive feedback (accumulation) + Threshold (crisis)
RELATIONAL: Parasitism (exploitation) + Competition (firms)
INFORMATIONAL: Encoding (money) + Propagation (ideology)

All patterns operating simultaneously
Recognizing each reveals intervention points
```

------

### **Your Pattern Library:**

**Build personal library over time:**

```
PATTERN LOG

Pattern observed: ___________________
Where seen: _________________________
How recognized: _____________________
Predicted outcome: __________________
Actual outcome: _____________________
Lessons: ____________________________
```

------

### **Success Metrics:**

**You're pattern-fluent when:**

```
□ Recognize 20+ patterns instantly
□ Can name pattern operating in any system
□ Predict system behavior based on pattern
□ Know intervention points for each pattern
□ See multiple patterns operating simultaneously
□ Build personal pattern library
```

**Ready for L3.4 when:**

```
□ Pattern recognition is intuitive
□ Want to know WHERE to push (not just what patterns exist)
□ Ready for leverage point hierarchy
```

------

## **L3.4: LEVERAGE POINTS**

*Relations determining state - Ξ-Δ*

------

### **What It Is:**

12-level hierarchy of intervention points, from lowest to highest leverage.

Based on Donella Meadows' work, adapted for Soulware.

**The Principle:**

```
Not all interventions equal.

Some push points = massive change
Others = minimal effect despite effort

Leverage = Change produced per unit effort

High leverage = small push, big change
Low leverage = huge push, tiny change

Learn where to push.
```

------

### **The 12 Levels (Lowest to Highest):**

------

### **LEVEL 12: NUMBERS** *(Lowest Leverage)*

**What:** Constants, parameters, subsidies, taxes

**Examples:**

```
- Tax rates
- Minimum wage
- Budget allocations
- Interest rates
- Quotas
```

**Why Low Leverage:**

```
Numbers are easy to change (just policy)
But don't change system structure
System adapts to work around new numbers
Effect often temporary

Example: Raise minimum wage
  - Helps temporarily
  - But capitalism adjusts (prices rise, hours cut)
  - Structure unchanged
  - Problem persists
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ Quick relief needed
□ Low political cost
□ Part of larger strategy (not alone)
```

------

### **LEVEL 11: BUFFERS** *(Low Leverage)*

**What:** Stabilizing stocks, reserves, safety margins

**Examples:**

```
- Emergency funds
- Strategic reserves (oil, grain)
- Spare capacity
- Slack in system
- Insurance
```

**Why Higher Than Numbers:**

```
Buffers absorb shocks
Prevent catastrophic failure
Buy time for adaptation

But: Don't change underlying dynamics
Just make system more resilient to existing patterns
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System volatile
□ Want to reduce crisis frequency
□ Can't change structure yet (buffer while planning)
```

------

### **LEVEL 10: STOCK-AND-FLOW STRUCTURES** *(Low-Medium Leverage)*

**What:** Physical structure, plumbing, infrastructure

**Examples:**

```
- Road networks
- Building layouts
- Supply chains
- Distribution systems
- Physical infrastructure
```

**Why Higher:**

```
Physical structures constrain behavior
Hard to change once built
Lasting impact

But: Still within existing system logic
Don't change WHY things flow, just HOW
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ Building new thing
□ Renovating existing
□ Physical constraints matter
```

------

### **LEVEL 9: DELAYS** *(Medium Leverage)*

**What:** Time between action and consequence

**Examples:**

```
- Decision-to-implementation lag
- Feedback delay (quarterly reports vs real-time)
- Supply chain lead times
- Learning curves
- Generational turnover
```

**Why Medium:**

```
Delays cause oscillations, instability, overshoot

Shortening critical delays = more responsive system
Lengthening harmful delays = less reactivity

But: Requires understanding what delays matter
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System oscillating unstably
□ Overshooting/undershooting targets
□ Feedback too slow or too fast
```

------

### **LEVEL 8: NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS** *(Medium Leverage)*

**What:** Stabilizing, goal-seeking controls

**Examples:**

```
- Thermostats
- Speed governors
- Debt limits
- Environmental protections
- Price controls
```

**Why Medium-High:**

```
Negative feedback stabilizes
Keeps system within bounds
Prevents runaway

But: Can maintain bad equilibrium
Can be too weak or too strong
Can be captured/disabled
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System running away
□ Need stabilization
□ Want to maintain good state
```

------

### **LEVEL 7: POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS** *(Medium-High Leverage)*

**What:** Amplifying, self-reinforcing dynamics

**Examples:**

```
- Compound interest
- Network effects
- Arms races
- Virtuous/vicious cycles
- Snowball effects
```

**Why High Leverage:**

```
Positive feedback creates exponential change
Small initial difference → huge divergence

Can be virtuous (compound growth)
Or vicious (death spirals)

Weakening harmful positive feedback = major impact
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System in death spiral (weaken positive feedback)
□ Want rapid growth (strengthen virtuous positive feedback)
□ Tipping point approaching
```

------

### **LEVEL 6: INFORMATION FLOWS** *(High Leverage)*

**What:** Structure of who gets what information when

**Examples:**

```
- Transparency (making hidden visible)
- Feedback loops (connecting action to consequence)
- Monitoring systems
- Education (spreading knowledge)
- Whistleblowing
```

**Why High Leverage:**

```
Hidden information = dysfunctional behavior
Revealed information = changed behavior

Example: Energy bill showing real-time usage
  → People use less (without being told to)
  → Information changed behavior

Missing feedback = bad decisions
Restored feedback = better decisions
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ People acting on incomplete info
□ Consequences hidden from decision-makers
□ System opaque
```

**Soulware Example:**

```
Pressure Decoder = information flow intervention
Makes systemic mechanisms visible
Changes behavior by revealing structure
High leverage
```

------

### **LEVEL 5: RULES** *(High Leverage)*

**What:** Incentives, constraints, permissions, laws

**Examples:**

```
- Property rights
- Market rules
- Laws and regulations
- Social norms
- Voting systems
```

**Why Very High Leverage:**

```
Rules shape behavior
Change rules = change outcomes

But: Rules within existing paradigm
Don't question fundamental assumptions
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ Behavior misaligned with goals
□ Can change formal rules (legislation)
□ Can shift informal rules (norms)
```

**Examples:**

```
Low leverage rule change:
  - Raise minimum wage (number)
  
High leverage rule change:
  - Workers own companies (property rights)
  - Fundamentally different incentive structure
```

------

### **LEVEL 4: SELF-ORGANIZATION** *(Very High Leverage)*

**What:** Power to add/change system structure

**Examples:**

```
- Evolution (species self-organize)
- Markets (self-organizing allocation)
- Ecosystems (self-organizing complexity)
- Revolutions (society reorganizes)
- Cultural change (norms evolve)
```

**Why Very High:**

```
Self-organization = system can restructure itself
Creates novelty
Adapts to change
Generates new patterns

Most powerful systems self-organize
Most resilient systems self-organize
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System needs to adapt
□ Want emergence of new structures
□ Rigid system needs flexibility
```

**How To Enable:**

```
□ Increase diversity (more options to try)
□ Increase experimentation (safe to fail)
□ Increase selection (reward what works)
□ Reduce constraints (allow reorganization)
```

------

### **LEVEL 3: GOALS** *(Very High Leverage)*

**What:** Purpose of the system

**Examples:**

```
- Corporate goal: Profit vs wellbeing
- Nation goal: GDP growth vs happiness
- Personal goal: Status vs meaning
- Movement goal: Reform vs revolution
```

**Why Very High:**

```
Goal shapes everything else
Change goal = everything else follows

Same structure, different goal = totally different outcome

Example: Company
  Goal = profit → exploitation, extraction, externalities
  Goal = wellbeing → care, sustainability, community
  Same structure (company), different everything else
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ System functioning well but toward wrong end
□ Can shift collective purpose
□ Ready for deep change
```

**Difficulty:**

```
Goals are often implicit, unquestioned
Making goals explicit = first step
Changing goals = requires power/collective action
```

------

### **LEVEL 2: PARADIGM** *(Highest Leverage - Single System)*

**What:** Mindset, worldview, assumptions underlying system

**Examples:**

```
Paradigm shifts:
- Flat earth → round earth
- Geocentric → heliocentric
- Nature as resource → nature as sacred
- Humans separate from nature → humans part of ecosystem
- Competition as natural → cooperation as natural
- Scarcity mindset → abundance mindset
- Linear growth possible → limits exist
```

**Why Highest Leverage:**

```
Paradigm determines what's possible, thinkable, acceptable

Change paradigm = change everything

Same facts, different paradigm = different world
```

**Examples:**

```
Old paradigm: Humans dominate nature
  → Exploitation, extraction, ecological destruction
  
New paradigm: Humans part of ecosystem
  → Regeneration, care, sustainability
  
Same actions (farming, building, living)
Completely different approach
```

**How Paradigms Change:**

```
□ Anomalies accumulate (old paradigm fails)
□ Alternative articulated (new paradigm offered)
□ Critical mass shifts (enough people convert)
□ Old guard dies (generational turnover)

Can take decades
But when it shifts: Everything changes
```

**When To Use:**

```
□ Systemic problems resistant to all other interventions
□ Fundamental assumptions wrong
□ Ready for revolutionary change
```

------

### **LEVEL 1: TRANSCENDING PARADIGMS** *(Highest Leverage - Meta)*

**What:** Ability to shift between paradigms, hold multiple simultaneously

**Examples:**

```
- Recognizing all paradigms are constructs
- Holding paradox (both/and not either/or)
- Cognitive flexibility
- Epistemic humility
- Knowing you could be wrong
```

**Why Ultimate:**

```
Not stuck in any paradigm
Can use different paradigms as tools
Can create new paradigms
Can transcend entire framework

This is meta-cognition
This is wisdom
```

**How To Develop:**

```
□ Study multiple paradigms
□ Notice your own assumptions
□ Practice perspective-taking
□ Hold paradoxes without resolving
□ Accept uncertainty
□ Cultivate intellectual humility
```

------

### **Using Leverage Points:**

**Strategy:**

```
DON'T: Only push at low leverage (numbers, buffers)
  → Lots of effort, little change
  → System adapts, you exhausted

DO: Identify highest accessible leverage point
  → Might be lower than ideal
  → But highest you can actually reach

IDEAL: Work at multiple levels simultaneously
  □ High leverage (paradigm shift)
  □ Medium leverage (rules, feedback)
  □ Low leverage (numbers, temporary relief)
  
  All together = systemic change
```

**Example: Fighting Poverty**

```
LOW LEVERAGE (Common approach):
- Increase welfare payments (numbers)
- Food banks (buffers)
- Job training (individual intervention)
→ Helps individuals, system unchanged

MEDIUM LEVERAGE:
- Strengthen labor unions (negative feedback on exploitation)
- Increase minimum wage meaningfully (rule)
- Universal basic income (structural change)
→ Changes power dynamics

HIGH LEVERAGE:
- Worker ownership of companies (rule change)
- Democratize workplaces (structure change)
- Make housing a right not commodity (goal change)
→ Changes system fundamentally

HIGHEST LEVERAGE:
- Shift from "poverty is personal failure" to "poverty is structural violence" (paradigm)
- From "wealth = virtue" to "wealth = theft" (paradigm)
→ Changes everything
```

------

### **Leverage Point Assessment:**

**For any intervention, ask:**

```
1. What level is this? (1-12)
   ___________________________________________________________

2. Is this highest leverage I can access?
   □ Yes → Do it
   □ No → What's higher that's accessible?

3. What would higher leverage look like?
   ___________________________________________________________

4. Can I work at multiple levels?
   Low: __________________________________________________________
   Medium: _______________________________________________________
   High: _________________________________________________________

5. What's blocking access to higher leverage?
   □ Don't have power
   □ Don't have collective support
   □ Don't have resources
   □ Paradigm blocks it from being thinkable
```

------

### **Success Metrics:**

**You understand leverage when:**

```
□ Can identify leverage level of any intervention
□ Default to higher leverage (not just easy low leverage)
□ Know highest accessible point for your context
□ Can work at multiple levels simultaneously
□ See why most interventions fail (too low leverage)
```

**Ready for L3.5 when:**

```
□ Leverage point thinking is automatic
□ Want to test before committing
□ Ready for scenario simulation
```

------

## **L3.5: SCENARIO SIMULATION**

*Relations determining trajectory - Ξ-uΔ*

------

### **What It Is:**

Mental testing protocol before real-world commitment.

Trace forward from proposed intervention to likely long-term effects.

**The Principle:**

```
Reality testing is expensive (time, resources, risk)
Mental simulation is cheap (just thinking)

Simulate first
Act second

Catch catastrophic errors in imagination
Not in reality
```

------

### **The Five-Step Protocol:**

------

### **STEP 1: BASELINE MAP**

**Question:** What's the current system state?

**Map:**

```

```

------

### **STEP 2: INTERVENTION DESIGN**

How will I change it:
___________________________________________________________________

Resources required:
- Time: ___________________________________________________________
- Money: __________________________________________________________
- Social capital: _________________________________________________
- Energy: _________________________________________________________

Access:
□ I have access to make this change
□ I need others' cooperation
□ I need permission/power I don't have
□ This is collective action (need organizing)

Reversibility:
□ Easily reversible (can undo)
□ Partially reversible (some consequences permanent)
□ Irreversible (no going back)
```

------

### **STEP 3: FORWARD TRACE**

**Question:** If I do this, what happens next?

**Trace Multiple Time Horizons:**

**t+1 (Immediate - Next Day/Week):**

```

How they react:
___________________________________________________________________

New state (Δ):
___________________________________________________________________

Feedback effects:

- On Φ: ___________________________________________________________
```

**t+7 (Short-term - Next Month):**

```
SHORT-TERM EFFECTS (t+7)

After initial reaction, what adjusts:
___________________________________________________________________

Who adapts, how:
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

Is this better or worse than baseline? ___________________________
```

**t+30 (Medium-term - Next Quarter):**

```
MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS (t+30)

After adaptation settles, what's new normal:
___________________________________________________________________

What unintended consequences emerged:
___________________________________________________________________

What feedback loops activated:
___________________________________________________________________

New state (Δ):
___________________________________________________________________

Baseline trajectory (uΔ):
□ Improved from intervention
□ Returned to baseline (intervention ineffective)
□ Worse than baseline (intervention backfired)
```

**t+90+ (Long-term - Next Year+):**

```
LONG-TERM EFFECTS (t+90+)

After full system adaptation:
___________________________________________________________________

Structural changes (if any):
___________________________________________________________________

New equilibrium:
___________________________________________________________________

Sustainability:
□ Sustainable (can maintain)
□ Temporary (will decay)
□ Requires ongoing effort

Was this intervention worth it? ___________________________________
```

------

### **STEP 4: FAILURE ANALYSIS**

**Question:** What could go wrong?

**Four Scenarios:**

**BEST CASE:**

```
Everything goes better than expected:
___________________________________________________________________

Probability: ____%

Required conditions:
___________________________________________________________________
```

**LIKELY CASE:**

```
Most probable outcome:
___________________________________________________________________

```

**Failure Mode Analysis:**

```
COMMON FAILURE MODES:

□ Implementation failure (can't execute as planned)
□ Unintended consequences (side effects worse than problem)
□ System adaptation (adapts around intervention)
□ Resistance (powerful actors fight back)
□ Resource depletion (can't sustain effort)
□ Timing wrong (too early or too late)
□ Scale mismatch (intervention wrong level)
□ Cascade triggers (sets off chain reaction)

Which modes most likely for this intervention?
___________________________________________________________________
```

------

### **STEP 5: DECISION**

**Question:** Should I do this?

**Decision Matrix:**

```
DECISION CRITERIA

1. RISK/REWARD RATIO:
   Expected benefit: ______________________________________________
   Expected risk: _________________________________________________

**Final Decision:**

```
□ EXECUTE
  Do it as planned
  Monitor effects
  Adjust as needed

□ MODIFY
  Change intervention design
  Reduce scope
  Test smaller version first

□ REJECT
  Don't do this
  Too risky, too costly, or won't work
  Find different approach

□ WAIT
  Not ready yet
  Need more resources/support/time
  Revisit later

### **Complete Simulation Example:**

**SCENARIO: Should I quit my exploitative job?**

```
STEP 1: BASELINE MAP

Entities:
- Me (worker entity)
- Employer (company entity)
- My family (depend on my income)

Flows:
- My labor (flowing to company)
- Money (salary flowing to me)
- Stress (company to me)

Relations:
- Employment (exploitative - long hours, low pay, no benefits)
- Economic dependence (I need money for survival)
- Social isolation (job prevents social life)

Current State:
Burned out, resentful, baseline degrading, but financially surviving

Baseline Trajectory: Degrading (getting worse each month)

Key Pattern: Parasitic extraction (company gains, I lose health)

Key Leverage Point: Exit the relation (quit)

---

STEP 2: INTERVENTION DESIGN

What: Quit job

Leverage Level: 5 (Rule change - property of my time)

Variable: Ξ (exit employment relation)

How: Give two weeks notice, leave

Resources Required:
- Time: 2 weeks notice period
- Money: Need savings buffer or new job lined up
- Social capital: Might need references (complicates exit)
- Energy: Moderate (actual act not hard, consequences scary)

Access: I have right to quit (legally)

Reversibility: Partially reversible (can get new job, but not THIS job)

---

STEP 3: FORWARD TRACE

t+1 (Immediate - Next Week):

Changes: No more job, relief but also panic
Who reacts: Boss angry, coworkers surprised
Their reaction: Boss might badmouth me, coworkers sympathetic
New state: Unemployed but not as exhausted
Feedback: Ω partially restored (not being extracted), Φ stress reduced, Ξ relation ended

t+7 (Short-term - Next Month):

Adjustment: Looking for new job, using savings, resting
Adaptation: Baseline improving (sleeping better, less anxious)
System response: Job market difficult, savings depleting
New state: Recovering but financially stressed
Better or worse: Better health, worse finances

t+30 (Medium-term - Next Quarter):

New normal: Either found new job or savings very low
Unintended consequences: References complicated, gap in resume
Feedback loops: If found better job → upward spiral, if not → financial crisis
New state: Depends on job search success
Baseline: If new job better → improved, if not → worse than before

t+90+ (Long-term - Next Year):

After adaptation: Hopefully in better job OR had to take worse job out of desperation
Structural: Relationship to work changed (won't tolerate exploitation same way)
New equilibrium: Depends heavily on luck/market/skills
Sustainability: Can't just keep quitting, need stable income eventually
Worth it: Depends on outcome - if better job, yes; if worse situation, no

---

STEP 4: FAILURE ANALYSIS

BEST CASE (20% probability):
Find better job quickly, conditions great, higher pay, better balance, baseline thrives
Required: Strong resume, good market, lucky timing, solid interview

LIKELY CASE (50% probability):
Find equivalent or slightly better job within 2-3 months, moderate improvement, baseline stable/slightly better
Based on: Average job search timeline, my qualifications, market conditions

WORST CASE (25% probability):
Job search takes 4-6 months, savings depleted, forced to take worse job, baseline worse than before
Causes: Bad market, unlucky timing, burned bridges

CATASTROPHIC CASE (5% probability):
Can't find job at all, savings gone, lose housing, spiral into crisis
Survivable: Barely - would need safety net (family, friends, aid)
Can I afford this risk: Depends on savings buffer and support network

Failure Modes:
☑ Implementation failure (sabotage job search through burnout)
☑ Unintended consequences (financial crisis)
☐ System adaptation (not applicable here)
☑ Resistance (boss bad reference)
☑ Resource depletion (savings run out)
☑ Timing wrong (quit during bad job market)
☐ Scale mismatch
☐ Cascade triggers

Most likely: Resource depletion if job search takes too long

---

STEP 5: DECISION

1. RISK/REWARD RATIO:
   Benefit: Health restored, escape exploitation, dignity
   Risk: Financial crisis if can't find job quickly
   Worth it: Only if I have buffer/support

2. REVERSIBILITY:
   Undo: Can get new job (not this one though)
   Cost: Time, energy, possible worse job

3. RESOURCE COST:
   Have: Some savings (3 months?), moderate marketability
   Opportunity cost: Staying means continued degradation

4. ALTERNATIVES:
   - Set boundaries at current job (tried, failed)
   - Find new job FIRST then quit (safer)
   - Reduce hours (not allowed)
   - Unionize (no coworkers interested)
   Best alternative: Find new job FIRST

5. TIMING:
   Now: Desperate but not yet catastrophic
   Wait: Could build more savings buffer first

6. COLLECTIVE:
   Need others: No (individual decision)
   But: Would help to have support during search

7. INTUITION:
   Feel: Torn - want to escape but scared of poverty
   Gut: Says find new job first, then quit

DECISION: □ MODIFY

Don't quit yet.
Instead: Job search while still employed (safer)
When new job secured: Then quit
This reduces catastrophic risk
```

### **When Simulation Says "Don't Do It":**

**Sometimes simulation reveals intervention won't work:**

```
Common reasons:
□ Leverage too low (won't change system)
□ Resources insufficient (can't sustain)
□ Timing wrong (too early/late)
□ Catastrophic risk too high (can't afford failure)
□ Better alternatives exist (should do that instead)

Response: Don't force it

Either:
- Modify intervention (reduce scope, change approach)
- Wait (build resources, wait for better timing)
- Choose different intervention (find better leverage point)
- Accept constraint (some things can't change yet)

Simulation exists to catch bad ideas BEFORE executing
Listen to the simulation
```

------

### **Simulation Limits:**

**What Simulation Can't Do:**

```
□ Predict with certainty (future is unknowable)
□ Account for all variables (too complex)
□ Capture emergence (surprising patterns arise)
□ Simulate social dynamics perfectly (humans are unpredictable)

Simulation = educated guess
Not certainty
But better than no analysis
```

**Use Simulation For:**

```
✓ Catch obvious disasters before they happen
✓ Compare multiple options (simulate each)
✓ Identify resource needs
✓ Prepare for likely scenarios
✓ Think through unintended consequences

Not for:
✗ Guarantee success
✗ Eliminate all risk
✗ Replace real-world testing
```

------

### **Success Metrics:**

**You're simulation-competent when:**

```
□ Simulate before major decisions
□ Can trace forward multiple time horizons
□ Identify failure modes reliably
□ Compare multiple interventions via simulation
□ Catch bad ideas before executing
□ Update simulations based on reality feedback
```

------

## **LAYER 3 COMPLETE**

------

### **You've Finished L3 When:**

```
□ Understand CRIT equation (can apply to any system)
□ Can map systems using K4 (identify all four primitives)
□ Recognize patterns across contexts (20+ patterns instantly)
□ Know leverage points (can identify intervention level)
□ Simulate before acting (forward trace, failure analysis)

Result:
- Systemic literacy developed
- Can understand any system
- Know where to push
- Test before committing
- Ready for collective action

Moved from reactive to strategic
```

------

### **Graduation to Layer 4:**

**You're ready for L4 when:**

```
□ L3 tools working (understand systems deeply)
□ Want to actually CHANGE systems (not just understand)
□ Ready for collective action (individual tools have limits)
□ Have comrades (can't organize alone)
□ Willing to build alternatives (not just critique)
```

------

**LAYER 3 COMPLETE.** 🎉

**You understand how the pump works.**

**Now you can build different pumps.**

**That's L4.**
